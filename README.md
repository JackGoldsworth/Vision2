#Vision 2.0
This is a re-write of my original project Vision. I am doing this re-write to help me learn Kotlin,
but more importantly, to clean up the code. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of Python as a OOP language,
and I thought a language on the JVM would scale better instead, so it was either between Kotlin, Groovy, and Java.
Obviously I chose Kotlin
